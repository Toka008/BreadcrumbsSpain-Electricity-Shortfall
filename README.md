# Spain Electricity Shortfall Case Study: Predicting Daily Shortfall With Machine Learning (AI)

## Overview
The Spanish government is thinking about making more purchases of renewable energy. They require data regarding Spain's present trends and patterns in the generation of both renewable and non-renewable energy in order to do this. In particular, they want to be able to forecast the load shortfall under specific circumstances (wind speed, pressure, humidity, etc.) on any given day. The distinction between the generation of renewable and non-renewable energy is load deficit.icly.

## Expected Outcomes
1. Identify energy generation trends and patterns
2. Create a regression model that predicts load shortfall
3. Present findings

## Tools Used
- Python
  SK Learn
  Pandas
  NumPys
- Flask
- AWS EC

## Output
With an RMSE of 3184 for the ensemble model, we came in second out of 38 teams. This implies that we could forecast the load deficit with accuracy.
